# djforecast

The concept of this application consists in analyzing and forecasting the Dow Jones index in real time, based on specified criteria and factors such as interest rate, discount rate, long-term bonds with a maturity of 30 years, prices for oil and grain, yield, and ect.
In this project, Iâ€™m using the following frameworks: Pandas, SciPy, Mathplotlib (to output the data to the graph), SkLearn (for "self-learning" of the program).
It works according to the following principle:
In real time, the program takes the above data and factors, analyzes them, carries out the necessary calculations and according to the previous experience (predetermined, and subsequently achieved in the "self-study" process) gives the result, as these factors being updated (on average every 5-8 minutes).

It is not finished yet, and does not works properply.
